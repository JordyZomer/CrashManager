# CrashManager

A tool that interacts with docker containers that are fuzzing stuff with libfuzzer, this also analysis the crash logs and represents that in the output.

You could see it as a hack-it-yourself OSS-Fuzz alternative.

The fuzzing containers itself are entirely based upon https://github.com/ouspg/libfuzzerfication/tree/master .
